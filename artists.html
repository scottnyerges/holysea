                <h2>mike vernusky, composer</h2>
                <p>A downpour inside a cathedral. Air through the eyes. Helicopters taking off from decks.</p>
                <p>Composer Mike Vernusky works in electronic sound and field listening, traversing the possibilities of found sound as metaphor and recontextualizing spectral spaces through the use of unconventional musical devices. His music has been described as ‘brash’ by New York Times, and 'especially otherworldly' by New Music USA.</p>
                <p>Mike Vernusky's music has been performed at Festival International de Música Experimental São Paulo, Sonic Mmabolela South Africa, MATA NYC, Visiones Sonoras Mexico, GMEM Marseille, and Experimental Intermedia. Vernusky holds degrees in Composition from UT at Austin and Performance from Mercyhurst University. He is a proud alum of the WordBridge Playwrights Lab, where he worked alongside directors, actors, dramaturgs, playwrights, mathematicians, behavioral scientists, and improv artists. Mike's recorded music is published on BBC Audio, MIT Press, The Wire, and Quiet Design, among others.</p>
                <p>Mike Vernusky has long-standing and ongoing collaborations with theatre artist and writer Greg Romero, film artist and photographer Scott Nyerges, and theatre maker and visual artist Khristián Méndez Aguirre, currently taking form as a collaboration inside The Holy Sea.</p>

              <p>Romero’s site-specific experiments and immersive live events include: a walking, guided tour through a dozen perishable events staged throughout West Philadelphia; an afternoon in which strangers met in the library to share their dreams; a performance experienced in an elevator descending from a historic hotel in downtown Louisville; and two plays staged simultaneously, speaking to each other through the bathrooms of Actors Theatre of Louisville during The Humana Festival for New American Plays.</p>
              <p>Romero enjoys an ongoing collaboration with composer Mike Vernusky on performance projects that have been presented live in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Austin, Baltimore, and Phoenix; and received airplay in Toronto, Ontario as part of New Adventures In Sound Art’s Deep Wireless Festival, and in Zürich, Switzerland as part of Digital Art Weeks, produced by Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich.
