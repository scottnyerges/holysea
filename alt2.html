      <p>Started in 2010, The Holy Sea is a sonic odyssey in eight parts, loosely based on the liturgical Mass. Consisting of Red, White, Blue, Purple, Green, Black, Pink, and Clear, each portrait follows an orbit of radiophonic art, electroacoustic sound, religious rite, found sounds and theater machine. Every sound is extracted from hundreds of pre-existing & highly obscure vinyl records and placed into an entirely new and allegorical conversation about Life, Love, Spirituality, and Death.</p>

      <p>Composer Mike Vernusky works in electronic sound and field listening, traversing the possibilities of found sound as metaphor and recontextualizing spectral spaces through the use of unconventional musical devices. His music has been described as ‘brash’ by New York Times, and 'especially otherworldly' by New Music USA.</p>
      <p>Mike Vernusky's music has been performed at Festival International de Música Experimental São Paulo, Sonic Mmabolela South Africa, MATA NYC, Visiones Sonoras Mexico, GMEM Marseille, and Experimental Intermedia. Vernusky holds degrees in Composition from UT at Austin and Performance from Mercyhurst University. He is a proud alum of the WordBridge Playwrights Lab, where he worked alongside directors, actors, dramaturgs, playwrights, mathematicians, behavioral scientists, and improv artists. Mike's recorded music is published on BBC Audio, MIT Press, The Wire, and Quiet Design, among others.</p>
      <p>Mike Vernusky has long-standing and ongoing collaborations with theatre artist and writer Greg Romero, film artist and photographer Scott Nyerges, and theatre maker and visual artist Khristián Méndez Aguirre, currently taking form as a collaboration inside The Holy Sea.</p>
